## üßëüèª‚ÄçüöÄ my ethernaut write-ups and solution in foundry

<br>

##### üîã this project contains solutions for **[openzeppelin's ethernaut wargames](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)**. leveraging **foundry**, each level has a test set (`.t.sol`), a script set (`.s.sol`), and write-up. some levels also have a exploit `src/.sol`.
##### üîã do you remember overthewire? **[here is my WeChall profile from playing it in 2014](https://www.wechall.net/profile/bt3gl)**.
