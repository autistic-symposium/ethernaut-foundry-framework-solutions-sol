## üßëüèª‚ÄçüöÄ my ethernaut write-ups in foundry

<br>

##### üîã this project contains my write-ups on **[openzeppelin's ethernaut wargames](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)**.

##### üîã to respect the challenge, i am not sharing explicit solutions (only for the first problem). instead, i provide: *i)* a discussion of the research i did or routes i took while solving them, and *ii)* their setup and boilerplates. this should give you enough tooling to come up with your own answers. you may check my 1337 progress at the **[ethernaut's leaderboard](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/leaderboard)**.
##### üîã probably out of context, but **[here is my wechat profile from playing overthewire in 2014](https://www.wechall.net/profile/bt3gl)**.
